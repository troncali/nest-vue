# Why?

Packages, tools, and applications take time to research, select, configure, optimize, and deploy across different platforms, environments, and repositories. This monorepo collects an opinionated (but customizable) implementation of these various decision points with default selections that balance security, performance, and developer productivity. There are also [other benefits of a monorepo](https://nx.dev/guides/why-monorepos).

However, this monorepo is just a starting point. Use it as a base to build upon, add or replace parts to make it a more ideal stack, or simply use it as a reference to implement pieces in another project.
